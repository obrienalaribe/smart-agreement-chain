## Zombienet

### Installation

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)

Install [minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)

Install the latest [Zombienet release](https://github.com/paritytech/zombienet/releases)

Make the downloaded Zombienet release file executable:
`chmod +x zombienet-linux`

Move it in another folder and add that folder into your shell path:
`export PATH=/.../zombienet-releases/:$PATH`

Restart your shell: `source ~/.bashrc`

### Build Rust Docker image

```
  docker build -f zombienet/Dockerfile.base -t gcr.io/paid-network-202104/rust:2004ubuntu220530 .
  docker push gcr.io/paid-network-202104/rust:2004ubuntu220530
```

---

### Build & Push Collator Docker image

```
  docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.build -t gcr.io/paid-network-202104/collator:build .
  docker build -f zombienet/Dockerfile.zombie -t gcr.io/paid-network-202104/collator:zxx .
  docker images
  docker push gcr.io/paid-network-202104/collator:zxx
```

---

### Start minikube

`minikube start`

### Running Zombienet Tests

Assuming the zombienet-linux executable is in thie repo.

-   Run only the network definition spec

```
  export POLKADOT_VERSION=v0.9.xx
  export COLLATOR_VERSION=zxx
  zombienet-linux -p kubernetes spawn zombienet/0001-small-network.toml
```

-   Run the test file(.feature file extension)

```
  export POLKADOT_VERSION=v0.9.xx
  export COLLATOR_VERSION=zxx
  zombienet-linux1236 -p kubernetes test zombienet/0001-small-network.feature
```

If all is successful, it should show something like this in the commandline:

```

Now we can read the collator logs:
`kubectl logs -f collator01 -c collator01 -n zombie-38bea45391d4dff4d95532e368906b02`

We can also click on the collator URL to see the collator node's settings and other blockchain information via polkadot.js.org:
`https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws%3A%2F%2F127.0.0.1%3A39737#/explorer`

Click on Network -> Explorer -> Node Info: confirm you can see 2 peers. For example:

```
12D3KooWRkZhiRhsqmrQ28rt73K7V3aCBpqKrLGSXmZ99PTcTZby	authority	130	0xad3a492a22e12ff865fea93f3e3e44df8dbb8ffd9559749f8a0569062cd2a7bf
12D3KooWQCkBm1BYtkHpocxCwMgR8yjitEeHGx8spzcDLGt2gkBm	authority	130	0xad3a492a22e12ff865fea93f3e3e44df8dbb8ffd9559749f8a0569062cd2a7bf
```

`12D3KooWQCkBm1BYtkHpocxCwMgR8yjitEeHGx8spzcDLGt2gkBm` matches relaychain node Alice as Added Boot Nodes: `/ip4/172.17.0.6/tcp/30333/ws/p2p/12D3KooWQCkBm1BYtkHpocxCwMgR8yjitEeHGx8spzcDLGt2gkBm`

Click on Network -> Parachains:

```
parachains		          lifecycle		included	backed	timeout	chain	in/out	leases

Val. Group 0 (1)
5HEGXSâ€¦9AWfnh (0)
Non-voters (0)
```

Click on Network -> Explorer -> ChainInfo, confirm you can see many blocks being produced:

```
recent blocks
397  0xf5c6e28b506171ea78940d1708ea37c5624f64a997f3fd5f3341f11034345fb1	 5HEGXSâ€¦9AWfnh

```

Confirm that 5HEGXSâ€¦9AWfnh and 5GKbySâ€¦DQBe64 match what you saw in your command line logs:

```
ðŸ§¹ Starting with a fresh authority set...
	  ðŸ‘¤ Added Genesis Authority alice - 5HEGXSoZGCkj1dYC1VLKEfd1tU7c9SyyiDcT7HHC4n9AWfnh

```

> NOTE: if the test fails, you should see something like:
> `/tmp/zombie-f8c1ff353b229713cdf72d1e3d27cf7f_-240705-tF0mvN38Aga5/logs`, then you can look up the relay chain nodes' logs via VS Code: `code /tmp/zombie-f8c1ff353b229713cdf72d1e3d27cf7f_-240705-tF0mvN38Aga5/logs`

### Test objectives and their corresponding test code

-   Check the relay chain node 1 is up: satisfied by "alice: is up" in the test feature file

-   Check the relay chain node 2 is up: satisfied by "bob: is up" in the test feature file

-   Check the parachain is registered within certain time: satisfied by "alice: parachain 2000 is registered within 225 seconds" in the test feature file

-   Make sure the parachain produces blocks: satisfied by "alice: parachain 2000 block height is at least 6 within 150 seconds" in the test feature file

### Test Feature file

alice: is up
bob: is up
alice: parachain 2000 is registered within 225 seconds

bob: log line matches glob "_rted #1_" within 10 seconds
bob: log line matches "Imported #[0-9]+" within 10 seconds
bob: log line matches "Imported new block." within 10 seconds

alice: parachain 2000 block height is at least 6 within 150 seconds
