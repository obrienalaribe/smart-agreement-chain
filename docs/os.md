## Operating System Concerns
> NOTE: Ubuntu Linux or its derivative Linux distributions like Linux Mint is recommended to be used as the target testing operating system.

Quote from the [Polkadot's Initial Set-up](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/maintain-guides-how-to-validate-polkadot#requirements): "The most common way for a beginner to run a validator is on a cloud server running Linux. You may choose whatever VPS provider that your prefer, and whatever operating system you are comfortable with. For this guide we will be using Ubuntu 18.04, but the instructions should be similar for other platforms."
