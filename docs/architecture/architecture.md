# Architecture

The scope of this document is to describe the architecture of the `hero`-chain.

It attempts to outline the constraints and goals and cover implementation details.

## Goals

Model legal contracts with simple litigation, disputes and mediation. This goes along with the contract definition and acceptance criteria, as well as submitting
proof.

## Stages

The document is split into stages, each stage should be deemed as a changeset of the prior stage, where `stage-00.md` is the baseline.
Once a stage is completed, the next stage should be folded into `stage-00.md`, such it becomes the donkey's carrot.
